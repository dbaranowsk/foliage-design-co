practice company website

Project for my Front-End Engineer course from Codecademy.

This website uses HTML and CSS to create an example website for a business.

This project highlights creating a layout for a static webpage. I used basic CSS and Flexbox to create the layout.
I increase the amount of documentation in the files and begin to organize stylesheet better.
